Welcome to the documentation for **Firestone Idle Bot** by [div0ky](https://div0ky.com). Hopefully you'll find everything you need to know within these pages. If you think something is missing, please feel free to reach out.

## Requirements

Everything you need to get going is included in the pre-built binary installers available for download. The bot does rely on `Google's Tesseract` engine to read items on the screen. The installer is included with the Firestone Idle Bot installer. Just make sure at the last screen you leave the box checked and it'll launch the installer for `Tesseract`. 

!!! note
    If you'd prefer, you [can download it yourself](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) from *UB-Mannheim*. Just be sure to download the 32-bit edition.
